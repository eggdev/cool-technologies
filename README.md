# Cool Technologies

This is a list of cool technologies I think can come in handy while working on software teams


### Front End

[Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js)
- Server side rendering for React applications
- Pretty much just using React with added performance benefits from SSR

[Redwood.js](https://github.com/redwoodjs/redwood)
- An infancy version of serverless web apps using React and Node.
- This has the potential to be a game changer for Javascript engineers, in my opinion

[Preact](https://github.com/preactjs/preact)
- Way tiny version of React
- Would be ideal for things like scripts for clients to add to their own site
- A lot of libraries work along side it

### Front End UI Libraries

[Material UI](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui)
- Allows for faster speed to market with Material Design components for your application
- Custom themeing and overrides allow for significant customizabilty
- Is quite large so hopefully can find a smaller alternative that does the same thing in the future

### Tools for development

[cracl](https://github.com/eggdev/cracl)
- Shameless plug of my own React CLI tool
- Allows for config file to generate components for your custom applications
- Still in infancy but I think will be cool for the community

### Github Integration

[Semantic Pull Requests](https://github.com/zeke/semantic-pull-requests)
- This package will alert your PR's if they are not formatted properly, passing a warning to PR checks

### Site Stability

[Fullstory](http://fullstory.com/)
- Session replay and heatmapping tool
- Will integrate with Sentry (below) to allow for better bug tracking

[Sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/)
- Application monitoring to catch JS errors (among many others) to keep track and fix bugs faster


### Product Testing

[LaunchDarkly](https://launchdarkly.com/)
- Feature Flagging
- Can push up code and have their features turned off so they don't break prod
- Allows for really simple roll backs and "test" runs

### Project Management

[Youtrack](https://www.jetbrains.com/youtrack/)
- Super customizable
- Loved the keypress actions feature 

[Clubhouse](https://clubhouse.io/)
- Really smooth UI 
- Good chat features and progress indicators

### Analytics

[Mixpanel](https://mixpanel.com/)
- Segmenting users by errors works in this
- Really powerful easy to use tool for tracking
